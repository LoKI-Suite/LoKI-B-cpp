    type of experiment under consideration, so that, for a given gas and a
    fixed value of E/ N, differences are obtained for steady-state Townsend,
    pulsed Townsend and time-of-flight experiments It is shown that this is an
    unnecessary complication since each experiment can be analysed in terms

    should be presented in a manner which would assist not only in the analysis
    of the above experiments but also in other swarm studies in progress.

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the characteristics of high-frequency
    and direct-current argon discharges at low pressures is carried out and a
    comparison of the basic properties of these discharges is presented. This
    analysis uses recent calculations of electron energy distributions and
    collision rate coefficients in argon under the action of uniform AC and DC
    electric fields together with a steady-state discharge model expressing the
    balance between collisional ionisation of the gas and the loss of electrons
    to the wall. The electric field strength, E, required for the steady-state

    for the discharge tube Lambda , assuming predominant direct ionisation.

  abstract = {In the first part of this paper we briefly review some basic
    concepts of kinetic theory. The concept of the velocity distribution
    function is first introduced and its meaning is discussed. Then, the
    Boltzmann equation is presented on physical grounds and it is shown that
    the fluid equations are its moments. In the second part, the Boltzmann
    equation for free electrons in a low-temperature plasma is analysed. It
    is shown how this equation can approximately be solved for electrons
    under a HF field of frequency ω (including the particular case of a
    dc field, which corresponds to the limit ω = 0) by using a first-order
    double expansion in spherical harmonics in velocity space and a Fourier
    series in time. The electron transport parameters, particle balance and
    energy balance are analysed from a general point of view. Finally, an
    application to argon and nitrogen is given. The effects of changes in the
    field frequency on the electron energy distribution function, transport
    parameters and power balance are discussed. The importance of the coupling
    between the electron and the vibrational kinetics in N2 is emphasized.

    inaccurate power absorption and reaction rate coefficients and results in
    errors in plasma parameter prediction in high power microwave (HPM) driven
    discharges. In this work, a GM was developed with a pressure-independent
    enhanced EEDF and enhanced power absorption model to improve fidelity
    for modeling HPM breakdown, and extended to two decades in applied
    frequency. The GM is applied to HPM breakdown in air at high pressure
    and over a wide frequency range, and results compared well with PIC-MCC
    simulations as well as experimental data.

    reduced electric fields in the interval 10  −  4  −10 Td
    where the electron-neutral encounters are limited to elastic, rotational
    and vibrational collisions. Rotational excitations/de-excitations are
    described using the following three different approaches: the discrete
    inelastic/superelastic collisional operator, written for a number of
    rotational levels that depends on the molecular gas and the specific
    rotational cross sections considered; the continuous approximation
    for rotations; a modified version of the continuous approximation for
    rotations, including a Chapman–Cowling corrective term proportional to
    the gas temperature. The expression of the rotational collision operator
    for this latter approach is deduced here and the results show that it
    bridges the gap between the discrete and the continuous descriptions at
    low/intermediate reduced electric fields. The calculations are compared
    with the measurements for the available swarm parameters to assess the
    validity of the different approaches and cross sections adopted to
    describe the rotational mechanisms.
