journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the characteristics of high-frequency and direct-current argon discharges at low pressures is carried out and a comparison of the basic properties of these discharges is presented. This analysis uses recent calculations of electron energy distributions and collision rate coefficients in argon under the action of uniform AC and DC electric fields together with a steady-state discharge model expressing the balance between collisional ionisation of the gas and the loss of electrons to the wall. The electric field strength, E, required for the steady-state operation of planar and cylindrical discharges is calculated as a function of the gas density N, the angular frequency omega , and the diffusion length for the discharge tube Lambda , assuming predominant direct ionisation.}

  title = {Electron kinetics in atomic and molecular plasmas},
  journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
  abstract = {In the first part of this paper we briefly review some basic concepts of kinetic theory. The concept of the velocity distribution function is first introduced and its meaning is discussed. Then, the Boltzmann equation is presented on physical grounds and it is shown that the fluid equations are its moments. In the second part, the Boltzmann equation for free electrons in a low-temperature plasma is analysed. It is shown how this equation can approximately be solved for electrons under a HF field of frequency ω (including the particular case of a dc field, which corresponds to the limit ω = 0) by using a first-order double expansion in spherical harmonics in velocity space and a Fourier series in time. The electron transport parameters, particle balance and energy balance are analysed from a general point of view. Finally, an application to argon and nitrogen is given. The effects of changes in the field frequency on the electron energy distribution function, transport parameters and power balance are discussed. The importance of the coupling between the electron and the vibrational kinetics in N2 is emphasized.}

The measurements were made in a crossed‐beam apparatus with the use of a fixed hemispherical electrostatic analyzer and a rotatable electron gun. The observed spectra were integrated over angle to obtain relative cross sections for secondary‐electron production. It was found that the shapes of the spectra of all the gases (except Ar, Kr, and Xe, which contain intense electron emission features in this energy range) were smooth and qualitatively similar, approaching a constant cross section at low secondary energies, and falling off at high secondary energies slightly faster than Es−2, where E8 was the energy of the secondary. The shape of the spectrum was found to be nearly independent of primary energy in He, O2, and N2.}",

  title = {The role of rotational mechanisms in electron swarm parameters at low reduced electric field in N2, O2and H2},
  journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
  abstract = {The homogeneous Boltzmann equation for electrons in N2, O2 and H2 is solved under the classical two-term approximation, for reduced electric fields in the interval 10  −  4  −10 Td where the electron-neutral encounters are limited to elastic, rotational and vibrational collisions. Rotational excitations/de-excitations are described using the following three different approaches: the discrete inelastic/superelastic collisional operator, written for a number of rotational levels that depends on the molecular gas and the specific rotational cross sections considered; the continuous approximation for rotations; a modified version of the continuous approximation for rotations, including a Chapman–Cowling corrective term proportional to the gas temperature. The expression of the rotational collision operator for this latter approach is deduced here and the results show that it bridges the gap between the discrete and the continuous descriptions at low/intermediate reduced electric fields. The calculations are compared with the measurements for the available swarm parameters to assess the validity of the different approaches and cross sections adopted to describe the rotational mechanisms.}
